<b>Story</b>
<br>
Most of humans have died.
<br>
Aliens changed the climate and now winter overcame all the planet.
<br>
Some humans have survived and stole aliens technology.
<br>
Thanks to this the survivors used this technology to build vechicles, weapons and bases.
<br>
You are drone controlled by the survivors from headquaters and you have to protect bases, bunkers and villages from aliens and upgrade defences in them by finding technological atrefacts.
<br>
More over you have to destroy alien bases.
