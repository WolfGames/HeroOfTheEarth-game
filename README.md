<b>Story</b>
<br>
Most of humans have died.
<br>
Aliens changed the climate and now winter overcame all the planet.

Some humans have survived and stole aliens technology.

Thanks to this the survivors used this technology to build vechicles, weapons and bases.

You are one of survivors and you have to protect bases from aliens and upgrade defences in them by finding technological atrefacts.
